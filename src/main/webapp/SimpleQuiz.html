<center> <h3> Machine Leaarning and k-NN pre-test </h3> </center>
This is the pre-assessment to learn about prior knowledge of machine learning. It helps us to position a student to where you should start in our tutorial. It will take about 5 minutes at most. If you know the answer for a question, please choose your answer. If you haven't heard about the concept being asked, please click on "I haven't learned it yet". <br>

Do your best to answer each question. Thank you.
